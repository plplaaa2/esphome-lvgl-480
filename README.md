**Note, this is for reference, not for everyone.**

This is for Korean users and does not fit the English language.

The weather included in the source has to use certain components in Korea, so you have to change the weather sensor to one that suits you.

Also, there's no image file here, which is a free image, but it's not included because it's copyrighted. 

You have to find and use this part on your own.
